## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        dictionary = {
            "2" : ["a","b","c"],
            "3" : ["d","e","f"],
            "4" : ["g","h","i"],
            "5" : ["j","k","l"],
            "6" : ["m","n","o"],
            "7" : ["p","q","r","s"],
            "8" : ["t","u","v"],
            "9" : ["w","x","y","z"]
        }

        stack = deque([])

        for num in digits :
            if not stack :
                stack = deque(dictionary[num])
            
            else :
                n = len(stack)
                for _ in range(n) :
                    node = stack.popleft()
                    for i in dictionary[num] :
                        stack.append(node + i)
        
        return stack
```

## Thoughts
Unlike what I thought, backtracking is seeking incrementally a potential solution and if it doesn’t work out it doesn’t increment in that direction. Otherwise, return the solution.
