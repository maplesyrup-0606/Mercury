## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # attach even ones to the end
        # maintain last pointer
        if not head :
            return None

        tail = head
        operation = 1
        while tail.next : 
            tail = tail.next
            operation += 1
        
        count = 0
        curr = head
        while curr.next and curr.next.next:
            tail.next = ListNode(curr.next.val)
            tail = tail.next
            curr.next = curr.next.next
            curr = curr.next
            count += 1
            if count == operation // 2 : break
        
        return head
```

## Thoughts

It did work fairly simply but it is slow, it is $O(n)$ but I am not sure what my cause the speed to slow it down.

## Leetcode Solution (Optional)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head :
            return None

        odd = head
        even = head.next
        even_h = even

        while even and odd and even.next and odd.next :
            odd.next = even.next
            odd = odd.next
            even.next = odd.next
            even = even.next
        
        odd.next = even_h

        return head
```

I had an initial solution like this, but it wasnâ€™t working (wtf). I think it was because of the condition `while even and odd and even.next and odd.next ` is what I did wrong.
