## My solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head: return None

        nums = []
        root = head
        while root :
            nums.append(root.val)
            root = root.next

        curr = head
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1) :
            curr.val = nums[i]
            curr = curr.next
        
        return head
```

## Thoughts

It’s a fast solution, but there’s just something about the space complexity being $O(n)$ that I don’t like.

## Leetcode Solution (Optional)

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head: return None

        prev = None
        curr = head

        while curr :
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
        
        return prev
```

I feel like I have a common mistake with `linked lists`, my original solution most likely works but I don’t think that much about it.

In this one, we keep a pointer `prev` that keeps track of the most recent node. By changing around the `next` orders we just shift the nodes and reverse their order.
