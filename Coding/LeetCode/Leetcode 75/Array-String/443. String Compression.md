## My solution
```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        
        i = 0

        while i < len(chars) :
            j = i

            while j < len(chars) and chars[i] == chars[j] :
                j += 1
            
            if j == i + 1:
                i += 1
                continue
            
            count = j - i

            if count > 1: 
                count_str = str(count)
                chars[i + 1: i + 1] = count_str

                del chars[i+1+len(count_str):j+len(count_str)]
                i += len(count_str)
            
            i += 1

        return len(chars)
```

## Thoughts
I was quite stuck as it would fail like a small number, so I inquired around.

I learned two things
1. I can insert a string like `chars[i + 1: i + 1] = count_str`
2. I can delete a certain sequence (instead of popping) like `del chars[i+1+len(count_str):j+len(count_str)]`
