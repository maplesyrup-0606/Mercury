## My solution
```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        if len(flowerbed) == 1 : 
            if flowerbed[0] and n > 0 :
                return False
            
            if not flowerbed[0] and n > 1 :
                return False
        
            return True

        prev, curr = n, n

        while n > 0 :
            for i in range(len(flowerbed)) :
                if flowerbed[i] == 0 :
                    if i == 0 :
                        if not flowerbed[i + 1] :
                            flowerbed[i] = 1
                            n -= 1
                    elif i == len(flowerbed) - 1:
                        if not flowerbed[i - 1] :
                            flowerbed[i] = 1
                            n -= 1
                    else :
                        if not flowerbed[i - 1] and not flowerbed[i + 1] : 
                            flowerbed[i] = 1
                            n -= 1
                
                else :
                    continue

            prev = curr
            curr = n

            print(f'{curr} {prev}')

            if prev == curr :
                return False
            

        return True
```

## Thoughts
It seems hella inefficient to be checking for all these edge cases like this, though it still maintains $O(n)$. 

What if we use this approach. Find the distance between all one’s. And for distance $0 <d \le 2$, we can place two flowers and for distance $d \ge 3$, we can place two flowers or more. 

$1 \le d \le 2$ : 1 flower
$3 \le d \le 4$: 2 flowers
$5 \le d \le 6$: 3 flowers
$2n -1  \le d \le 2n$ : (up to) $n$ flowers 

But still need to consider the one’s so minus -2 on that.

## Leetcode Solution (Optional)
```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        count = 0 
        flowerbed = [0] + flowerbed + [0]
        
        for i in range(1,len(flowerbed)-1):
            if flowerbed[i] ==0 and flowerbed[i-1] !=1 and flowerbed[i+1] !=1:
                count+=1
                flowerbed[i] =1
                
        return count>=n
            
```

My solution of the distances was actually as worst as the first one, it includes the same amount of additional code for the edge cases. 

So I looked at the solution, which wasn’t as clean but it was decently ok.

==**I was SO DUMB for this**==
