## My solution
```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        left = [1]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)) :
            left.append(left[i -1] * nums[i - 1])
        
        right = [1]
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1) :
            right.insert(0, right[0] * nums[i + 1])
        
        ret = []

        for i in range(len(nums)) :
            ret.append(left[i] * right[i])

        return ret

```

## Thoughts
Worked the first time, but it is slow. There must be a way to reduce the number of loops.
I accidentally (😉) saw a solution mention “postfix” and “prefix”, so I’ll try making a solution with that. I believe it can be done within one for-loop instead of three as shown in my solution above.
