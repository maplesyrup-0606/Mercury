## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def removeStars(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []

        for c in s :
            if c == "*" :
                stack.pop()
            
            else :
                stack.append(c)
        
        return ''.join(stack)
```

## Thoughts
Initially I thought, what if we do a string operation directly. That would work, but it just makes life harder by tracking the pointer. So, I implemented a stack algorithm. This is much more simpler because we just push every character, and for each \* we just pop the stack.
