## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        if len(word1) != len(word2) : return False
        # check operation 1
        if set(word1) != set(word2) : return False
        # check operation 2
        freq1 = Counter(word1)
        freq2 = Counter(word2)

        list1 = list(freq1.values())
        list2 = list(freq2.values())

        return sorted(list1) == sorted(list2)
```

## Thoughts

Here’s how it works (under the condition the lengths are the same)

**Operation 1** : Swap any two **existing** characters.
**Operation 2** : Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.

In order for any number of operations work to check if they are similar, we can check each operation at a time

1. For operation 1 to work, the set of characters have to be the same. Since it’s just re-arranging we just have to have to have both strings consisted of the same characters.
2. For operation 2 to work, the total collection of frequencies have to be the same. Or else there would be a discrepancy of characters.

If these two conditions are satisfied, the two strings are similar.
