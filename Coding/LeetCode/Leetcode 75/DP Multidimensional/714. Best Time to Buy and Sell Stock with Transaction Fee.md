## Leetcode Solution (Optional)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        n = len(prices)

        buy = [0] * n
        sell = [0] * n
        buy[0] = -prices[0]

        for i in range(1, n) :
            buy[i] = max(buy[i - 1], sell[i - 1] - prices[i])
            sell[i] = max(sell[i - 1], buy[i - 1] + prices[i] - fee)
        
        return sell[-1]
```

Basically, we cannot sell before we buy and we cannot buy before we sell.

`buy[i]`: The max profit when buying at $i$ th day.
`sell[i]`: The max profit when selling at $i$ th day. 

For `buy[i]`, it’s either the case that we buy or keep it. Same for `sell[i]`, it’s either the case we sell or keep it.

`buy[i]` : If we choose to buy, we have to subtract `price[i]`the max profit from selling prior to $i$ .

`sell[i]`: If we choose to sell, we have to add `price[i] - fee` to the max profit from buying prior to $i$.
