## My solution

```python
class RecentCounter:

    def __init__(self):
        self.pings = []


    def ping(self, t: int) -> int:
        self.pings.append(t)
        count = 0
        for num in self.pings :
            if num >= t - 3000 and num <= t: 
                count += 1
        
        return count



# Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RecentCounter()
# param_1 = obj.ping(t)
```

## Thoughts

It’s hella slow, I think I should use a different approach since `It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than the previous call.`

## Improved Solution (Optional)

```python
class RecentCounter:

    def __init__(self):
        self.pings = []


    def ping(self, t: int) -> int:
        self.pings.append(t)
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(self.pings) - 1, -1, -1) :
            if t - 3000 <= self.pings[i] and self.pings[i] <= t :
                count += 1
            
            else :
                break
        
        return count


# Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RecentCounter()
# param_1 = obj.ping(t)
```

It’s a faster approach, but still slow.
## Leetcode Solution (Optional)

```python
from collections import deque
class RecentCounter:

    def __init__(self):
        self.q = deque()
        
    def ping(self, t: int) -> int:
        self.q.append(t)
        
        while t - self.q[0] > 3000:
            self.q.popleft()
            
        return len(self.q)
        
# Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RecentCounter()
# param_1 = obj.ping(t)
```

Mine always has a massive length of pings, while the leetcode solution just maintains array for numbers in a length that exist within the range. Dam, this is efficient.
