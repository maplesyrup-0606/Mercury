## My solution
```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        i = 0 
        count = 0
        n = len(nums)
        while i < n : 
            if nums[i] == 0 :
                count += 1
            i += 1
        
        nums += [0] * count

        i = 0
        count2 = 0
        while i < n :
            if nums[i] == 0 :
                nums.pop(i)
                count2 += 1
                i -= 1
                if count == count2 : break 
            i += 1
        
```

## Thoughts
It feels inefficient to be running the loop twice, this was only done because if I did one loop it would do it infinitely. I’ll try thinking up of a $O(n)$ solution.
## Improved Solution (Optional)
```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        i = 0 
        count = 0
        n = len(nums)
        while i < n : 
            if nums[i] == 0 :
                count += 1
                nums.pop(i)
                i -= 1
                n -= 1
            i += 1

        nums += count * [0]
```

This wasn’t necessarily improved. It did reduce it to O(n) though.
## Leetcode Solution (Optional)
```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        j = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)) :
            if nums[i] != 0 and nums[j] == 0 :
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            
            if nums[j] != 0 :
                j += 1
```

This was much better, while we iterate we find the 0’s. $j$ moves at a slower rate than $i$, so we will be able to swap all the leading 0’s.
