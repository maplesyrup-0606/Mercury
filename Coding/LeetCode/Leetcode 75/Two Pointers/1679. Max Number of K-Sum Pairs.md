## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        count = 0
        while left < right : 
            if nums[left] + nums[right] == k :
                count += 1
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            
            elif nums[left] < k - nums[right] :
                left += 1
            
            elif k - nums[left] < nums[right] :
                right -= 1
            

        return count
```

## Thoughts

It was a decent solution, I was stuck till I found that we can sort.
If we sort it (by default ascending order), we can examine each end.

1. If the sum matches → Narrow it
2. If the left is smaller than the sum - right → move the left side above
3. If the right is bigger than the sum - left → move the right side down

Although it seems nice (and it worked one try), I’ll think about a better solution. 
While still maintaining $O(n\log{n})$.
