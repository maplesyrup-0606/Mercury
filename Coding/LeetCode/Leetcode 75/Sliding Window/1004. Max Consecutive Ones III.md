## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)

        # increment right till zero == 0, once happens if next is 1 proceed 
        # but if next is 0 now we adjust the left pointer
        # when the left pointer passes a 0 we can increment the counter 
        zero = 0
        left = -1
        ret = 0

        for right in range(n) :
            if nums[right] == 0 :
                zero += 1
            
            while zero > k :
                left += 1
                if nums[left] == 0 :
                    zero -= 1
                    break
            
            ret = max(ret, right - left)
        
        return ret
```

## Thoughts

This was inspired by [[adjusting sliding window]] and [[1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element]].

Basically this is the process

1. if we encounter a 0 for `right`, we increment `zeros`
2. if `zeros` reaches `k` we adjust the left so that it finds the first zero and decrement `zero`
3. Then we measure the distance between `right` and `left` that have exactly `k` zeros in between

## Leetcode Solution (Optional)

```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        l = r = 0
        for r in range(len(nums)) :
            if nums[r] == 0 :
                k -= 1
            
            if k < 0 :
                if nums[l] == 0 :
                    k += 1
                l += 1
        
        return r - l + 1
```

This solution is much simpler compared to mine, instead of finding the first zero in a `while` loop, all it does is increment the left in the case we reached the cap. 
Then when adjusting the left pointer, it checks if the left pointer is at a zero or a one. 
And adjusts the count based on it.

Though, I like mine better itâ€™s easier to think of to be honest.
