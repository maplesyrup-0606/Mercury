## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        vowels = "aeiou"
        cur_str = s[:k]
        curr = 0
        for i in cur_str : 
            if i in vowels :
                curr += 1 

        ret = curr

        for i in range(1, len(s) - k + 1) :
            if cur_str[0] in vowels :
                curr -= 1
            if s[i + k - 1] in vowels :
                curr += 1

            ret = max(ret, curr)
            cur_str = cur_str[1:] + s[i + k - 1]
        
        return ret
```

## Thoughts

I got the solution, but it is somewhat very slow. I think it might happen due to string operations.
I will think of another way.

Current runtime : $O(n)$

## Improved Solution (Optional)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        vowels = set("aeiou")
        curr = 0
        for i in range(k) : 
            if s[i] in vowels :
                curr += 1 

        ret = curr

        for i in range(1, len(s) - k + 1) :
            if s[i - 1] in vowels :
                curr -= 1
            if s[i + k - 1] in vowels :
                curr += 1
            ret = max(ret, curr)
        
        return ret
```

I figured out that we never really needed to keep track of a string (It was referenced by AI lol).
I was dumb because I had half of this ready `if s[i + k - 1] in vowels :` here when the above was looking at the old version.
