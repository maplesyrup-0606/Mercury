## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def largestAltitude(self, gain: List[int]) -> int:
        ret = 0
        pre = 0
        for i in gain: 
            ret = max(ret, pre)
            pre += i
        
        return max(ret, pre)
```

## Thoughts

This was a pretty straight forward **prefix sum**
