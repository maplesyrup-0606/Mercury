## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        provinces = set()
        def dfs(visited, islands):

            n = len(islands)
            for i in range(n) :
                if islands[i] == 1 and i not in visited :
                    visited = dfs(visited + [i], isConnected[i])
            
            return visited
        
        for i in range(len(isConnected)) :
            visited = dfs([i], isConnected[i])
            provinces.add(str(sorted(visited)))

        return len(provinces)
```

## Thoughts
Way too slow. Need improvements.

My original thinking was getting the amount of connected components first, but maybe I can ignore that with not using recursion.

## Improved Solution (Optional)

## Leetcode Solution (Optional)

```python
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(isConnected)
        visited = n * [False]
        provinces = 0

        if not isConnected : return 0

        def dfs(u) :
            for v in range(n) :
                if isConnected[u][v] and visited[v] == False :
                    visited[v] = True
                    dfs(v)
        
        for i in range(n) :
            if visited[i] == False :
                provinces += 1
                visited[i] = True
                dfs(i)
        
        return provinces
```

To be honest, I thought it would be more overhead just to create a graph. But thinking of it, it still maintains $O(n^2)$ while my solution above is checking all the possible cases.
