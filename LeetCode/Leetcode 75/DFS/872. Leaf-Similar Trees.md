## My solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def leafSimilar(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        
        def dfs(root) :
            if not root.left and not root.right :
                return [root.val]
            
            else :
                vals = []
                if root.left :
                    vals += dfs(root.left)
                
                if root.right :
                    vals += dfs(root.right)
                
                return vals
            
        
        return dfs(root1) == dfs(root2)
```

## Thoughts
Similar to [[104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree]], I used a non-`self` approach. Very satisfying approach.

I could also do it with BFS but it would require some more,
1. More space complexity to keep track of previous level
2. Identify where it becomes null

But thinking of it, thinks it won’t be an equal level tree for all branches. 기각!
