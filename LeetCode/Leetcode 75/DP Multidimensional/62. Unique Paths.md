## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        memo = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
        
        for i in range(n) :
            memo[0][i] = 1
        
        for i in range(m) :
            memo[i][0] = 1
        
        for i in range(1, m) :
            for j in range(1, n) :
                memo[i][j] = memo[i][j - 1] + memo[i - 1][j]
        
        return memo[-1][-1]
```

## Thoughts
I recently used a combination approach with math, but this time I decided to use dp in multidimensions.
