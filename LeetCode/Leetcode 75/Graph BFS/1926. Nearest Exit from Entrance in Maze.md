## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def nearestExit(self, maze: List[List[str]], entrance: List[int]) -> int:
        row = len(maze) - 1
        col = len(maze[0]) - 1

        
        level = deque([entrance])
        steps = 0
        visited = set()
        visited.add((entrance[0], entrance[1]))
        while level :
            steps += 1
            for _ in range(len(level)) :
                curr = level.popleft()
                moves = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
                for move in moves :
                    temp = (curr[0] + move[0], curr[1] + move[1])

                    if temp in visited : 
                        continue

                    elif temp[0] < 0 or temp[1] < 0 or temp[0] > row or temp[1] > col:
                        continue

                    elif maze[temp[0]][temp[1]] == "." :
                        if temp[0] == row  or temp[1] == col or temp[0] == 0 or temp[1] == 0:
                            return steps
                        level.append(temp)
                        visited.add(temp)

                    else :
                        continue
        return -1


```

## Thoughts
Ok I got it right, but here are some things to pinpoint (since I needed external help to change the speed)

1. `str` conversion makes it heavily slow.
2. We can index in `tuples`.

But otherwise, the logic was right. Too bad I couldnâ€™t improve the speed. (Ty GPT)
