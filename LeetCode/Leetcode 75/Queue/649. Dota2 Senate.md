## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def predictPartyVictory(self, senate: str) -> str:
        n = len(senate)
        R, D = [], []
        for i in range(len(senate)) :
            if senate[i] == "R" :
                R.append(i)
            else :
                D.append(i)
            
        while R and D: 
            r = R.pop(0)
            d = D.pop(0)

            if r < d :
                R.append(r + n)
        
            else :
                D.append(d + n)
        
        
        if not R :
            return "Dire"
        
        if not D :
            return "Radiant"
```

## Thoughts

I have to admit, I peaked at the solution. 

Reasons I was confused,
	1. How could we maintain those who are left? (not killed by others)

That was simply solved (surprisingly by me) that we can append at the end the `index + length of voters`.
This was inspired that we are comparing by `index`.
