## My solution
```python
class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        num1 = num2 = float('inf')

        for num in nums :
            if num <= num1 : # gets min
                num1 = num
            
            elif num <= num2 : # gets second min
                num2 = num 
            
            else :
                return True

        return False
```

## Thoughts

This sol was kind of cheating as I skimmed through the last submission.

Basically, the idea is the following:
	1. Instantiate two numbers num1, num2
	2. Find the first minimum num1
	3. Then we find the next minimum num2
	4. If we find a number that’s both bigger than num1, num2 then we’re good

This can cover all cases, since we will always have num1 and num2 in ascending order. And num1, num2 will be constantly updated until a third minimum is found.
