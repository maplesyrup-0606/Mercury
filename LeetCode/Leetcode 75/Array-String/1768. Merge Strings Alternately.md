# My solution
```python
def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        i, j, k = 0, 0, 0
        res = ""
        while i < len(word1) and j < len(word2) :
            if k % 2 == 0 :
               res += word1[i]
               i += 1 
            else :
                res += word2[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        
        return res + word1[i:] + word2[j:]
```


## Thoughts
We do not really need `k` to indicate word1 or word2 â†’ this just increases time

# Improved Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        res = ""

        for i in range(min(len(word1), len(word2))) :
            res += word1[i] + word2[i]
        
        return res + word1[i + 1:] + word2[i + 1:]
```
