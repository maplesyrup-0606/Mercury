## My solution
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseVowels(self, s: str) -> str:
        vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
        left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
        s = list(s)
        while left < right :
            while left < len(s) and s[left] not in vowels :
                left += 1
            
            while right > -1 and s[right] not in vowels :
                right -= 1
            
            if left >= right : break

            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
            
        return ''.join(s)
```

## Thoughts
Seems like a pretty-clean $O(n)$ approach using *two-pointers*. At the moment I don’t see a point to improve it other than changing something about the list-converting thing.

Leetcode solutions seems to be similar, so I won’t post.
