## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        freq = {}

        for num in arr :
            if num not in freq.keys() :
                freq[num] = 1
            else :
                freq[num] += 1
            
        
        ret = 0 

        for num in freq :
            if (ret >> freq[num]) & 1 == 0:
                ret += 1 << freq[num]
            
            else :
                return False
            
        
        return True
```

## Thoughts
I lowkey did a bit of an overkill for this, I just tried using a bit-wise operation so that each spot in the binary would represent a certain frequency count
