## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:

        def dfs(keys, visited) :
            n = len(keys)

            for i in range(n) :
                if keys[i] in visited :
                    continue
                
                else :
                    visited.append(keys[i])
                    dfs(rooms[keys[i]], visited)
            
            return visited

        
        visited = dfs(rooms[0], [0])
        if len(visited) == len(rooms) :
            return True
        
        return False
```

## Thoughts
It is an awfully slow solution, time to improve it!

## Improved Solution (Optional)

```python

```

## Leetcode Solution (Optional)

```python
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:

        stack = [0]
        visited = set()

        while stack :
            room = stack.pop()
            visited.add(room)
            for key in rooms[room] :
                if key not in visited :
                    stack.append(key)
        return len(visited) == len(rooms)
```

We can use a `stack` for DFS and `queue` for BFS!
