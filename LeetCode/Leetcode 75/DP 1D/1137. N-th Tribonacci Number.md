## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def tribonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        trib = [0] * (n + 3)
        trib[0] = 0
        trib[1] = 1
        trib[2] = 1
        for i in range(3, n + 1) :
            trib[i] = trib[i - 1] + trib[i - 2] + trib[i - 3]
        return trib[n]
```

## Thoughts
This was 1-D so I didnâ€™t bother using recursion.
