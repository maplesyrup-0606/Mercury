## My solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def pairSum(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:
        nums = []

        while head :
            nums.append(head.val)
            head = head.next
        
        n = len(nums)
        ret = float('-inf')
        for i in range(0, n//2) :
            ret = max(ret, nums[i] + nums[n - i - 1])
        
        return ret
```

## Thoughts

As usual, I feel like there’s a way to improve it by not using more space. Plus, it is hella slow 🐌.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def pairSum(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:
        # get half of the linked list
        # reverse that half
        # iterate till max (for both)

        slow = head
        fast = head

        while fast and fast.next : 
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
        
        # now slow is the start where we should reverse
    
        prev = None

        while slow :
            temp = slow.next
            slow.next = prev
            prev = slow
            slow = temp
        
        ret = float('-inf')

        while head and prev :
            ret = max(ret, head.val + prev.val)
            head = head.next
            prev = prev.next
        
        return ret
    
        return 0

```

This is a leetcode inspired solution, it was the mix if [[206. Reverse Linked List]] and [[2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List]]. Amazing on god..
