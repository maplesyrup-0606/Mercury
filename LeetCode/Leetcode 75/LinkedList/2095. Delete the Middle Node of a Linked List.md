## My solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        n = 0

        temp = head
        while temp :
            n += 1
            temp = temp.next

        n = n // 2

        if n == 0 :
            return None

        point = head

        count = 0

        while point :
            if count == n - 1 :
                if point.next :
                    point.next = point.next.next
                break
            count += 1
            point = point.next
        return head
```

## Thoughts

It is a decent approach, but I think it can be cleaner by removing the edge case we did above.

## Leetcode Solution (Optional)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head :
            return None

        prev = ListNode(float('-inf'))
        prev.next = head
        slow = prev
        fast = head

        while fast and fast.next : 
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        slow.next = slow.next.next 
        return prev.next

```

This is a very good approach, since I didn’t have the idea of **we don’t need to measure the whole thing**. 

Given that, we have two pointers `fast` and `slow`.
`fast` moves twice at a time, while `slow` moves once at a time. Therefore, making them moving at two different speeds!
