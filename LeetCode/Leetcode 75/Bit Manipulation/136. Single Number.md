## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        res_ = 0
        for num in nums :
            if num >= 0 :
                res ^= (2 << num)
            
            else :
                res_ ^= (2 << (-num))
        
        if res == 0 :
            return -int(math.log(res_ // 2, 2))
        
        else :
            return int(math.log(res // 2, 2))

```

## Thoughts
It works fine, but it is just odd to divide cases for negative and odd numbers

## Improved Solution (Optional)

## Leetcode Solution (Optional)

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        x = 0
        for num in nums :
            x ^= num
        
        return x

```
Maybe my understanding was a bit wrong? I thought negative numbers might be different when doing bit manipulation. But thinking again, it does not affect it.
