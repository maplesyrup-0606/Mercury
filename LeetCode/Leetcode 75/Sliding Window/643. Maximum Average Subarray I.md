## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        curr = sum(nums[0:k])
        ret = curr
        for i in range(1,len(nums) - k + 1) :
            curr = curr - nums[i - 1] + nums[i + k - 1]
            ret = max(ret, curr)
        return ret / k
```

## Thoughts

Not gonna lie, but it took me a minute to think about it.
Since I wasn’t used to the concept of “sliding window”, I took some time to write down the flow.
This seems to he the optimal solution, so I won’t proceed.
