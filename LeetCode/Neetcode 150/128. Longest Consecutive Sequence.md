## My solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # hint use a set
        visited = set()
        nums = set(nums)
        res = 0
        for num in nums :
            if num in visited : 
                continue
            
            else :
                visited.add(num)
            streak = 1
            num += 1
            while num in nums :
                streak += 1
                visited.add(num)
                num += 1
            res = max(res, streak)

        return res 
```

## Thoughts
Looking up a hash set is $O(1)$ so this was a decent approach. I would like to work on my original one though. 
â†’ Follow up: My original solution would take too much time since we have to construct a graph and also dfs into it.
