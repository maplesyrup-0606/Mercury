## Problem 1

**(a),(b)**
See Excel sheet.

**(c)**
The current ratio is,
$$\frac{\text{Current Asset}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} = \frac{5025}{1675} = 3 > 2.$$
Hence, the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations is strong, indicating financial stability.

## Problem 2

See Excel Sheet.

## Problem 3

1)\
I would consider investing is **Index Funding** that track specific market indices like S\&P 500. My expected rate of return annually is around 7~10\% letâ€™s say an average of 8.5\%.

2)\
I would consider **Corporate Bonds**. These are debt securities issued by companies to raise capital. In general, the expected return is 3~6\% annually again an average of 4.5\%.

3)\
I would consider a **High-Yield Savings Account**. This offers a higher interest rate compared to traditional saving accounts, normally at rate of 1~3\% annually which is by average 1.5\%.

The MARR is a threshold for ROI. In the three cases mentioned above, my MARR would be 1.5\% since this is the lowest rate among the methods I have considered. Therefore, any investment must yield at least 1.5\% annually to be deemed attractive.
