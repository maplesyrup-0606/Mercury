## Building an Amortization Schedule

- For each period, the interest paid = interest rate times the balance remaining from the period before
- The principal payment = payment - interest paid
- Principal payment is applied to the balance remaining from the preceding period to calculate the new remaining balance

The annual payment equals to “interest” + “principal”.

**In Canada**: rates are compounded semi-annually by law.
- But *payments* are monthly (or even bi-weekly), so lenders determine monthly interest rates that are equivalent to the semi-annual declared rate.
For Instance,
	- 6\% rate
	- Semi-annual: 6\%/2 = 3\%
	- Effective annual: (1+3\%)^2 - 1 = 6.09\%
	- Equivalent monthly rate : (6.09\%)^(1/12) = 0.493862\%

## Types of Mortgages

### Conventional
For 80\% or less of the appraised value of the property, and as such they require the purchaser to make a down payment of at least 20\%.

### High-ratio 
Higher than 80\% and usually require an outside agency such as the CMHC to insure the mortgage.

### Some others
Open, variable rate, ARM (adjustable rate mortgage), capped rate, closed, convertible rate, second, reverse, and CHIP mortgage.


## Interest Rate Considerations

**Fixed mortgage rates** are influenced mainly by the bond market, starting with government-issued bonds (which set the tone for the market).

**Variable mortgage rates** are tied to lending rates that National banks set, for loaning money to financial institutions.

### Considerations
- Most people are risk averse: that means they would prefer less mortgage risk than more, all else the same.
- Fixed rates mean less uncertainty, which therefore usually cost more.
- These markets can move in different directions, leading to variability in gap between them.

## Equity
The value remaining in a property after all mortgage and loans registered against the title are subtracted from its value. (***The amount you actually have paid off***)
