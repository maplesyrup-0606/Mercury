## Project

A **project** is:
- A temporary activity that is carried out to deliver a specific product or service.
	- Has a beginning and an end.
	- Resources are assigned when it is ongoing and then reallocated to other activities when it is completed.
- Projects can be short and straightforward:
	- Ex) Moving a small piece of equipment.
- Projects can be large and complex.
	- Ex) Construction of the Confederation Bridge.


**Project Management is concerned with**:
- Processes of planning a project.
- Processes of organizing the resources.
- Processes of leading individuals working on the project.
- Processes of monitoring progress.
- Processes of implementing deliverables.

**Challenge**:
- To bring about goals and objectives of a project within constraints of time, scope and budget.

### Project Management Lifecycle

Dividing work into stages helps the PM plan resources for each stage, gauge achievements, and justify the project.

**Phases**:
1. **Initiation**: nature and scope defined.
	- Normally documented through a terms-of-reference document or project charter.
2. **Planning**: broken down into modules, sequence, resources identified.
	- This information is recorded in the project plan document.
3. **Execution**: work carried out to deliver product or service.
	- Most of the effort and cost are expended at this stage.
4. **Monitoring and Control**: constant assessment of issues and risks carried out.
	- Project plan document is compared with actual progress.
5. **Closure**: ensure customer satisfaction and agreement.
	- Review and document lessons learned.

- Not all projects will pass through every phase.
- Some projects will pass through the planning, execution, and monitoring and controlling stages several times.
- Each industry may have different issues that need to be managed carefully.
- All projects start with an idea for a:
	- Product, service or change that will produce benefits.
- A sponsor is identified when an idea gets to the point where its implementation is being considered.
- ***Project Sponsor***:
	- A person or group that has the resources to complete the project and acts as the project champion.
- Sponsor leads development of Project Charter which includes the following components:
	- **Background**: Why? Who benefits?
	- **Objectives**: Key project goals - are they measurable?
	- **Methodology**: What methodology will be used?
	- **Justification**: Is it feasible? Do benefits outweigh costs?
	- **Requirements**: What are the required features and functions?
	- **Constraints**: What restrictions are there? (time, budget, etc.)
	- **Assumptions**: What factors are considered “true”?
	- **Risks**: What uncertainties would impact the project? Controllable?
	- **Deliverables**: What outcomes are necessary to meet objectives?
- With initiation phase approved, the PM is responsible for developing a detailed **project plan**.
- Primary purpose of the project plan:
	- Estimate the time, cost and resources needed to complete the project as set out in the project charter.
- A thorough project plan increases the likelihood that a project will be successful.
- A **project plan** includes:
	1. Project Scope
		- Overall goal, justification, deliverables, success criteria.
	2. Project Team
		- Who is responsible to carrying out the work, skills needed.
	3. Work Breakdown Structure
		- Nature and scope of each activity, activity relationships, responsibility for tasks.
	4. Project Schedule
		- Time for each tasks, sequences, start and finish times, major milestones.
	5. Budget
		- Cost drivers, costs and their timing.
	6. Risk Plan
		- Major risks, impacts and management.
	7. Communication Plan
		- What aspects should be communicated, audience and timing of project updates.

### Initiation
- Actual work of the project is done.
- Initiating processes defined in the project plan.
- PM selects the team and coordinates people and resources to produce the deliverables.
- Deliverables:
	- Outputs of the project as defined in the project charter.

### Monitoring and Controlling
- This process takes place throughout the execution stage.
- PM tracks progress such that potential problems are identified and corrective action taken.
- PM measures progress against the project plan.
	- Corrective actions are taken to adhere to the project plan.
- Included in this stage are:
	- Reviewing the project activities.
	- Monitoring the project constraints.
	- Identifying corrective actions.
	- Implementing changes.
- This phase concludes when the project’s goals and objectives have been met.
	- **Project can also be terminated prior to coming to a conclusion.**

### Closure
- Closure occurs when all activities defined in project are completed, project signed off with sponsor, team is disbanded.
- *Project closure report* documents the conclusion of the project, assessing its performance.
	- “Lessons learned” should be noted.
- Documents that the sponsor has accepted final deliverables.

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

**Work breakdown structure**:
- Used to organize all the work to be done in a project.
- Decomposes the project into successively smaller units.
- At the lowest level, each work package represents a specific deliverable.


Constructing a WBS helps identify:
- Activities involved in a project
	- Resources necessary to complete them.

Typically, a WBS is shown in one of two ways:
1. Diagram that resembles an Organizational chart.
	- Topmost layer represents the project as a whole.
2. Indented List
	- Each successive layer is indented from the layer above.
	- Used for complex projects with thousands of line items.


Items at the lowest level of the WBS can be used to estimate resources.
WBS is the basis for estimating costs and scheduling.

## Gantt Charts

**Gantt Charts**:
- depict timing and sequence of project activities.
- most common example of the 2nd way to visualize a work breakdown structure: indented list.
- simplest, most fundamental tools available.
- consists of a list of work items and a diagram indicating when each item begins and ends.
- Start a Gantt chart from the WBS.
- Each activity is a row of bars indicating the task and showing their start and end.
- Diamonds indicate an event.
- A PM can use a Gantt Chart to monitor project progress.
- great tool for determining precedence among tasks.

## Network Representation of the Schedule: CPM and PERT

Precedence relationships are difficult to manage and communicate for larger projects.
- Reduces the effectiveness of Gantt charts as a planning and control tool for larger projects.
- Led to the development of the:
	- Critical Path Method (CPM)
	- Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

After developing a WBS and understanding precedence relationships.
- It is necessary to visualize the project using a network diagram.

Two main ways of developing network diagrams:
1. Activity on arc (AOA)
2. Activity on node (AON)

Developing an activity visualization is crucial to implementing CPM and PERT.

- CPM was developed for projects with certain task times that can be shortened through the use of additional resources.
	- Allows for cost and time tradeoffs on a project.
- PERT was developed for projects where task times are assumed to be uncertain.
- For both CPM and PERT, activities can be represented by AOA or AON.


### Activity on Arc (AOA) and Activity on Node (AON)

**ARC**:
- Arcs represent activities.
- Nodes are used to capture interrelationships between activities.

**AON**:
- Nodes represent the activities instead of arcs.
- Currently the most popular method.

### Project Scheduling and the Critical Path Method

- Network representation along with precedence relationships enables PM to identify the **critical path**.
- Critical path is set of activities that must be completed exactly as planned to keep project on schedule.
- Delaying any one activity will cause Project Delay.
- Finding the critical path involves **two** passes through network.

**1st Pass**: Earliest start/finish times for each activity determined.
- Referred to as the “**forward**” pass.
- Provides the earliest feasible completion time for the project.

**2nd Pass**: Pass goes in reverse. 
- It starts with completion time and computes *latest time* each activity can start and finish.
- Referred to as the “**backward**” pass.
- Identifies the activities that can start and finish later than the dates found in the “forward” pass without delaying the project.


==**Activities for which the earliest start time and the latest start time are the same are on the critical path.**==
- No slack available in their start and finish dates.

Notation:
- Duration of each activity: $T$
- Earliest start: $ES$
	- Max($EF$ of immediate predecessors)
- Earliest finish: $EF$
	- $ES + T$
- Latest start: $LS$
	- $LF -T$
- Latest finish: $LF$
	- Min($LS$ of successor activities)



The Critical Path can be determined once the second pass is complete.
Critical path is the **longest path in terms of time through the project network**.
- Activities on it are referred to as critical activities.
	- Recognized as those for which $ES=LS$ and $EF=LF$.

- Activities not on the critical path have:
	- $ES < LS$
	- $EF < LF$

Scheduling flexibility is referred to as slack, $S$.
$$S=LS-ES=LF-EF$$
Activities on the critical path have $S=0$.



- Strength of CPM is that it provides mechanism for **crashing** a project, i.e., reduce completion time with additional resources.
- Resources can be overtime, extra equipment, additional staff - all at greater cost.
- PM’s need to make a tradeoff between the extra costs associated with crashing and the reduced project completion time.


$$\text{Crash cost per unit time} = \frac{\text{crash cost- normal cost}}{\text{normal time - crash time}}$$
