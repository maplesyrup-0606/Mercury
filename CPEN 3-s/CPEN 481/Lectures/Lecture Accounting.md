## Primary Financial Statements
![[Pasted image 20240618131050.png]]

**Consider**:
- Timing: `One point in time` vs. `Over a time period`
- Purpose of each statement: view provided
- Items included in statement
- Historical versus Projected
- Audience: Tax, Legal, Banks, Investors, Own Business
- Connection between financial statements


## Balance Sheet (Finance Statements)
- Every organization has **assets** and **liabilities**.
- Assets - Liabilities = **Owner’s Equity** (Company value)
- **Balance Sheet** is a snapshot of its financial position. It summarizes assets, liabilities and owner’s equity.
- **Assets**: items to which the organization has legal title.
	- **Current Assets**: Can be converted into cash within one year.
	- **Fixed Assets (capital assets)**: Have a life greater than one year.
- **Liabilities**: debt owed (suppliers, employees, government)
	- **Current Liabilities**: debt normally paid within a year (accounts payable, taxes, wages payable, bank loan payable …)
	- **Long-term Liabilities**: debt normally paid beyond current year.
- **Owners’ Equity**: Difference between assets and liabilities.
	- Means of measuring the organization’s worth.
	- Often appears as the two:
		1. Stocks, or shares
		2. Retained earnings
	- Better off the owners as equity builds up.


The balance sheet is a **snapshot** of a firm’s financial position **at a particular point in time**.
It summarizes assets, liabilities and owner equity.

The income statement summarizes revenues and expense **over a period of time**. 
- Revenues, expenses, profits before taxes, taxes paid and profits after taxes.


Financial statements are often estimates:
- use cost principle of accounting:
	- Assets are valued on the basis of their cost (book value).
	- Land is listed at the price paid, not its market value.
	- Plant and equipment is listed at the price paid less accumulated depreciation.
	- Stock or Shares are listed at *par value* (issue price).
	- Finished goods inventory - manufacturing cost.

### Current vs. Long term
**Current assets** are expected to be or could be converted into cash within 12 months.

**Long Term assets** (such as land or factories) are not expected to be converted into cash during the company’s normal course of operations. Valued at book value.

**Current Liabilities** are debts that must be paid within one year.

**Long-term Liabilities** are debts that will be paid over more than one year.

==Pre-paids are actually current assets==

Ex) 
For an engineering industry, the total current and long-term assets are \$13,815,000 and the total current and long-term liabilities are \$2,180,000 and \$1,200,000 respectively. The total equity is \$10,435,000.

$$\text{Assets} = \$13,815,000= \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity} = (\$2,180,000+\$1,200,000)+(\$10,435,000)$$
$$ = \$13,815,000$$

## Net Worth Statement
- Presents the *solvency* of the firm by reporting the firm’s assets and liabilities at one point in time.
- Assets and liabilities are valued at fair market value
	- Value that an asset would sell for in the marketplace at one point in time if sold to a knowledgeable, arms-length and willing buyer and a reasonable time is allowed to complete the transaction.

### Market Value Estimations
1. **Direct Comparison Approach** - Value estimated by analyzing completed sales, listings or pending sales of properties that are similar to the subject property. Need to adjust for differences.
2. **Cost Approach** - Determine the cost to replace or reproduce the asset - adjust for physical wear and tear, functional deficiencies and external influences (easiest with newer assets)
3. **Income Approach** - Estimates property’s annual income and expense to convert the net income into a present value.

## Income Statement
- Summarizes the firm’s revenues and expense over a period of time associated with operating activities.
- Profit or loss result: demonstrates financial efficiency, potential for growth.
- Also known as profit and loss statement.
	- **Revenue (R)**: money the company earns from its sales of products or services.
	- **Expenses (E)**: money the company spends to produce the goods or services that it sells (Variable and Fixed expenses).
	- **Net Income (Profit/Loss)**: Value computed as Revenue minus Expenses. Represents money earned or loss for a specific time period.
	- **Net Profit**: Profit after taxes.

**EBIT** - Earnings before interest and taxes
- Total revenue *minus* operating expenses.
	- Operating expenses: all expenses except for income tax and interest.
- Measures a company’s operating profit.
	- Results from making sakes and controlling operating expenses.
	- Used to determine if there is enough profit to recoup the cost of capital.


## Cash Flow Statement
Portrays liquidity of a firm. Similar to the Income Statement, but narrower in scope.
**Meets specific needs**: Focused on short-term ability to pay bills, and having cash to support near-term decisions, as well as long-term cash issues.

- *Cash inflow money* (cash and cash-equivalents): going into a business.
- *Cash Outflow money* (cash and cash-equivalents): going out of the business.
- *Net Cash Flow*: difference between a cash inflows and cash outflows during a specific time period and represents the change in a company’s cash balance.

## Uses of Operating Revenues
$$\text{Operating Revenue (OR)} = \text{Operatin Cost (OC)} + \text{Before-tax cash flow (BTCF)}$$
![[Pasted image 20240619161138.png]]

### Examples of Different Definitions
“**Net**”:
Usually means ‘net of’, meaning something has been subtracted out.
$$\text{Net revenue} = \text{Revenue minus cost} = \text{Before-tax Cash Flow}$$

“**Net Profit**”:
Some say,
$$\text{Revenus minus variable costs minus fixed costs}$$
Others say,
$$\text{Net Profit} = \text{Profit After Taxes} \neq \text{BTCF minus taxes}$$

## Financial Ratios and Analyses
- Decision makers (inside and outside) need to know general “health” of a firm.
- Can use balance sheet and income statements to assess “health” of a firm.
- **Financial Ratio Analysis** → key performance indicators.
- These performance measure are **financials ratios** calculated from items on the income statement and balance sheet.
- In interpreting ratios, analysts should:
	- Calculate ratios over a number of periods to do a **trend analysis**.
	- Ratios should also be compared to **industry standards**.

### Terminology
- **Solvency**: Firm’s ability to meet **all** financial obligation, $A > L$.
- **Liquidity**: Firm’s ability to meet their **current** financial obligations as they come due.
- **Efficiency**: Firm’s ability to use assets effectively.
- **Profitability**: Firm’s ability of a business to produce a return on an investment based on its resources (little different than profit).
- **Financial Flexibility**: Firm’s ability to react and adapt to financial adversities and opportunities.

### Liquidity Ratios
Measures a company’s ability to pay off its current liabilities with its current assets such as cash, accounts receivable and inventories.
- It is important because this assurance of liquidity support satisfies employees, suppliers and creditors.

**Working Capital** = Current Assets minus Current Liabilities.
→ Measures reserves of cash and liquid assets.

$$\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$
- Shows the ability of a firm to cover current liabilities.
- Historically, firms have aimed to be at or above a ratio of 2.0.

**Benchmarks**:
- Green: > 1, can cover all short-term obligations.
- Yellow: = 1, can just cover short-term obligations.
- Red: < 1, cannot cover short-term obligations.

**Quick Ratio (Acid Test Ratio)**
$$\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets - Current Inventories}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$
- Shows the ability of a firm to pay debt quickly.
- “Quick” assets are Current Assets minus Current Inventories.
- Current Inventories are excluded from quick assets because it takes time to sell them and get cash.
- A ratio of 1 is considered adequate.

==Same Benchmark as above.==

**Interest Coverage Ratio**
$$\frac{\text{(Net) earnings before interest and taxes}}{\text{annual interest expense}}$$

Ex)
![[Pasted image 20240619164350.png]]

$$\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{8770}{2180}  = 4.0229357798$$
$$\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{1940 + 950 + 4100}{2180} =  3.2064220183$$
![[Pasted image 20240619170244.png]]$$\text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{920+20+300}{120}=10.3$$

### Solvency Ratios

**Equity Ratio** (a.k.a Equity to Asset)
$$\frac{\text{Owner Equity}}{\text{Total Asset}} = \frac{\text{Net Worth}}{\text{Total Asset}}$$
- Uses Balance Sheet, or Net Worth values, or both.
- Smaller the ratio, the more dependent a firm is on debt and higher the risk of not being able to manage debt.
- Comparison to industry norms/trend analysis is necessary.
- Relationship between Debt and Equity Financing in the Firm.

**Debt to Equity Ratio** (Leverage Ratio)
$$\frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Owner Equity OR Variations}} = \frac{\text{long term debt + short term debt}}{\text{Owner Equity}}$$
- Uses Balance Sheet, or Net Worth values, or both.
- Relationship between Debt and Equity Financing in the Firm.
- Also - Measures the level of financial risk - higher ratio translates into higher financial risk.

**Benchmark**
- The higher this ratio, the riskier a creditor will perceive its exposure in your business to be, making it more difficult to obtain credit (loans).

**Interest Coverage Ratio**
$$\frac{\text{Total Income}}{\text{Interest Payments}}$$
- Indicates how much revenue must drop to affect the firm’s ability to finance its debt.
- This ratio should be at least 3.0 for industrial firms.
- Total income is total revenue minus all expenses except interest payments.
- Derived from Income Statement.

Ex)
![[Pasted image 20240619171724.png]]
$$\text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{3380}{10435} = 0.32$$
$$\text{Equity-to-Asset Ratio} = \frac{10435}{13815} = 0.76$$
![[Pasted image 20240619172114.png]]
$$\text{Interest Coverage Ratio} = \frac{920}{120} = 10.3$$

### Efficiency Ratios
- These ratios assess the efficiency of use of assets.

**Inventory Turnover Ratio**
$$\frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Inventories}}$$
- Uses a mix of income statement and balance sheet values.
- Industry standard is around 11 for this ratio.

### Profitability Ratios
- Profitability compares business earnings against all economic resources utilizes to create those earning - human and capital resources.
- Done to allow comparison to other investments - opportunity cost.

**Profit Margin**
$$\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Revenue}}$$

**Return on Equity (ROE)**
$$\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Owner's Equity}}$$
- You can use Net Worth values, if that is all you have available.
- Usually converted to percent value.

*Benchmark*
- Use opportunity cost - what else could the investment be earning?
	- Bank rate/Stock market rate.

**Return on Assets (ROA)**
$$\frac{\text{Net Income + Annual Interest Expense}}{\text{Average Total Assets}}$$
or,
$$\frac{\text{Net Income + Interest expense (1 - tax rate)}}{\text{Average Total Assets}}$$
- Use average TA if possible; (you can use Net Worth values if that is all that is available)
- Converted to percent usually
- Return (profits) generated for every dollar of assets owned by the business.

*Benchmark*
- Green: Greater than 12\%.
- Yellow: 6~12\%.
- Red: Less than 5\%.

==For ROE & ROA, the numerator is an amount from an annual net income statement, while the denominator is a balance sheet amount at one point in time.==
==Address by using average of two balance sheet amounts for denominator - rolling average: (Value end of current year + Value end of prior year) / 2, it might be misleading though.==


**Net Profit Ratio**
$$\frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Net Sales Revenue}}$$
- Indicates cost efficiency of operations and firm’s ability to convert sales into profits.
- Net sales revenue equals sales minus returns and allowances.

**Operating Profit Margin** (same as above?)
- Shows company’s ability to turn a dollar of revenue into a dollar of profit after accounting for all the expenses required to run the business.
- Ex) 25\% → earn \$1 and keep 25 cents as profit.

![[Pasted image 20240619174226.png]]

$$\text{Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Revenue}} = \frac{1120}{18030} = 6.2\%$$


**Benchmark**
- Green: Greater than 25\%.
- Yellow: 10 ~ 25\%.
- Red: Less than 10\%.

Ex)
![[Pasted image 20240619174408.png]]

$$\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Owner Equity}} = \frac{1120}{10435} = 10.7\%$$
$$\text{Net Profit Ratio} = \frac{730}{18030} =  4.0\%$$

![[Pasted image 20240619174703.png]]
$$\text{ROA} = \frac{1120 + 120}{13815} = 9.0\%$$

## Comparability of Financial Ratios

**Comparability**
- Analysis of a company’s financial information typically follows a three-pronged approach.
- Compare over time - Trends within a company’s using own financial information are analyzed.
- Compare between competing firms - Financial measures are compared between competitors.
- Compare to Industry averages.
- Encourages objective measure.

### Ratio Computations and Ratio Analysis
1. Understand the business. - firm factor.
2. Understand the nature & drivers of the industry in which the organization works. - industry factor.
3. Understand the competition. - other firms factor.
4. Understand that the overall state of the economy. - economic factors.

## Financial Risk and Business Risk

**Business Risk**: Risk of Net Income variation (and potential losses) due to price and quantity changes.
- Present in all businesses.
- Measured: Assess impact of business risk via
	- **Break-even Analysis**: define the unit required to cover all costs.
	- **What if Scenario Analysis**: allows us to look at the impact of key price or quantity values on net income.
	- How can we review if business risk is likely to occur?
		- Industry and Competitive Analysis.
- Source: External to business.
- Strategies: Mitigate but never eliminate.

**Financial Risk**: Risk due to fixed debt obligations. Too much debt means creditors / suppliers / bankers / investors have concerns over ability to pay.
- Measured: Review via
	- **Debt to Equity Ratio**: High versus low or even trend to increase/decrease.
	- **Profit Levels**: If you have lots of net income then maybe lots of debt payment can be ok.
- Source: Debt and thus fixed debt obligations.
- Strategies: Mitigate by ? Eliminate by ?

## Structuring a Business

**Sole Proprietorship**
- Business owned by one person.
- Simplest and least regulated form of business.
- Owner keeps all of the profit but at the same time has unlimited liability.

**Partnership**
- Business owned by two or more people.
- All profits and losses are shared according to the partnership agreement.
- In a limited partnership, some partners are only involved as investors.
	- Limited partners have limited liability.
- Personal assets are protected from creditors.

**Corporation**
- Owned by shareholders.
- Board of directors responsible for selecting managers to run the business.
- It is a business entity with its own rights and responsibilities, separate from the owners.
	- Owners have limited liability up to the amount of their investment.
