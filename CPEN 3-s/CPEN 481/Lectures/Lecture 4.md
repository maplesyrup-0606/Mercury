## Six Assumptions in Comparison Methods

1. Cost/Benefits always measurable in terms of money.
2. Future cash flows are known with certainty.
3. Cash flows are unaffected by inflation or deflation.
4. Sufficient funds available to implement all projects.
5. Taxes are not applicable.
6. All investments have a cash outflow at the start.

## Relations Among Projects

We classify projects as one of the three:
1. **Independent**: Can pick more than one (if budget allows).
	- Expected cost/benefits of each project are independent of whether other is chosen.
2. **Mutually Exclusive**: Can only pick one.
	- By virtue of choosing one all other alternatives must be excluded.
	- Impossible to do both.
3. **Related but not Mutually Exclusive**
	- For such, expected costs/benefits of one depend on other(s) being chosen.
	- Need to combine them into an exhaustive list of mutually exclusive sets.
	- $n$ related projects can be placed in $2^n$ sets, including the *do-nothing* option.

### Special Cases of Related Projects

1. One project is **contingent** on another.
	- Project A can be done alone, or A and B can be done together, but B cannot be done by itself.
	- Project B is contingent on A because it cannot be undertaken unless A is done first.
2. Resource or financial **constraints** (all **sets** of projects that meet the budget form a mutually exclusive set of alternatives).
	- Two office buildings at different sites, but only enough for financing one.


## Present / Annual Worth Comparisons

**For these methods**: Find a comparable basis to evaluate projects in monetary units.

- **Present Worth (PW) method**: Compare projects by computing their present worth at a given discount rate.
- **Annual Worth (AW) method**: Compare projects by computing their annual worth at a given discount rate.

***For both cases, we choose the one with greater worth when compared.***

* Mutually exclusive projects can be compared in terms of present cost or annual cost.
* Best alternative is the one with the minimum PW of cost as opposed to the maximum PW.
	* Two conditions must hold:
	  1. All projects have the same major benefit.
	  2. Estimated value of the major benefit clearly outweighs the project's cost.

1. If PW > 0; acceptable
2. If PW < 0; unacceptable
3. if PW = 0; marginally acceptable

- When considering projects with equal PW
	- Project assessed to have the higher intangible value should be selected.
- PW estimates with values within 10\% of each other should be considered equal
- AW is essentially same as PW


## Comparison of Alternatives with Unequal Lives

When making PW comparisons, same period must always be used to account for full costs/benefits of each alternative.
If service lives of alternative projects are unequal, we transform them into equal lives:
- **Repeated Lives Approach**: Repeat the service life of each alternative over the least common multiple of service lives.
- **Study Period Approach**: Adopt specified study period for comparison, realizing need of salvage value at the end of the period.
