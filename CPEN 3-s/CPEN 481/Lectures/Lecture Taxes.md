## Introduction

- Taxes are fees paid by individuals or businesses to support their government.
- Taxes can have a significant impact on the economic viability of a project.
- When a firm makes an investment, income from the project will affect the company’s cash flow.
	- If an investment yields a profit, the profit will be taxed.

- Taxes are a direct consequence of an investment.
	- They reduce the net profit associated with an investment.
		- Taxes associated with a project can be considered a disbursement.

- When evaluating a loss-generating project, the net savings in tax can be viewed as a negative disbursement.
- Depreciation tax rules provide certain incentives for firms to invest, and smooth out the tax reductions associated with asset purchase decisions.
- Income taxes:
	1. **Reduce the benefits of a successful project.**
	2. **Reduce the costs of an unsuccessful project.**


## Personal Income Taxes
Substantial differences exist between personal income taxes and corporate income taxes.

**Tax rates**:
- Personal income taxes usually based on a progressive tax rate.
- Income used to determine the taxes an individual pays is reduced by deductions or tax credits.

### Taxable Income of Individuals

- Average Tax Rate
$$\frac{\text{total taxes payable}}{\text{taxable income}}$$
- Marginal Tax Rate
$$\text{Tax rate that applies to the next taxable dollar}$$
- Typically, countries create a set of marginal tax rates that apply to different income levels.
- Provinces have their own tax rates.


### Basic Personal Exemption vs. Credit

- Exemption: income that isn’t subject to tax.
- Canada uses the word ‘credit’ interchangeably with ‘exemption’, but many countries don’t.
- Credit: reduction in actual tax amount.
- a tax credit reduces taxes much more than a tax exemption.

### Corporate Income Taxes

**Tax rate**:
- Corporate taxes are levied on income according to a proportional or “flat” tax.
	- Pay the same tax rate regardless of their income level.
		- Rates stay the same whether the company makes a small or large profit.
	- Usually more complex than personal taxes.
- For a corporation, taxes are calculated subtracting expenses from gross income.
	- A company that makes no profit pays no taxes.

Income statement example,
$$\text{BTCF} = \text{Operating Revenue} - \text{Operating costs}$$
$$\text{Taxable Income} = \text{OR} - \text{OC} - \text{CCA} - \text{Debt Interest (I)}$$
$$\text{Net Profit} = (\text{OR} -\text{OC}-\text{CCA}-\text{I})\cdot(1-\text{tax rate})$$

**Small Company Tax Rules**:
- Special tax advantages are often given to smaller companies.
	- Provides motivation to incorporate a new company & provide more after-tax income for reinvestment and expansion.

**Small Business Deduction**:
- Applies to small Canadian-controlled corporations.
- Reduces the effective tax rate to less than 20\%.


**Definitions and clarifications**:
- *Gross Profit*: Before tax, net sales minus cost of goods' sold.
- *Net Profit*: After all expenses, including tax.


## Before-and-After Tax

### MARR
Since taxes reduce profits, must set the appropriate “after-tax” MARR for project acceptability.
If impact of taxes is explicitly accounted for, then MARR used for project must be **after-tax MARR**.

$$\text{MARR}_{\text{after-tax}} \approx \text{MARR}_{\text{before-tax}} \cdot (1-t)$$

**Before-tax MARR** means that the MARR has been chosen high enough to provide an acceptable rate of return without explicitly considering taxes.

The after-tax MARR is generally lower than the before-tax MARR.

If a MARR is given without specifying whether it is on a *before-* or *after-* tax basis,
- It can be assumed to be a *before-tax* MARR.


## Capital investment business case analysis, including tax implications

==Component of a capital investment decision, including tax implications:==
- Asset purchase creates depreciation, a cost that reduces taxes owed.
- Asset purchase creates revenues or cost savings, which typically increase taxes owed.
- Asset sale creates revenue, which may create tax savings or additional tax costs.

## Simplified Analysis
***Simplified Condition:* Asset has no book value when it is sold.**
**Asset sale creates revenue, which create additional tax costs.**
### The Effect of Taxes on First Cost
Capital purchases such as production equipment usually cannot be fully claimed as an expense in the year in which the purchase occurred.
- Logic based on the idea of depreciation.

Given a choice, a firm would want to depreciate an asset as quickly as possible.
- Depreciation is an expense that offsets revenue.
	- The earlier the expense is recognized, the sooner the tax savings will accrue.

Tax authorities have defined the depreciation methods they permit for use in computing taxes.
- Permitted methods for claiming depreciation expenses may not reflect the true depreciation of an asset.
	- Consequently, the depreciation charge is referred to by a different name: **capital cost allowance**.

### Present Worth and Annual Worth Tax Calculations
For a present worth comparison, each of the component cash flows is converted to a present worth and summed.
- First cost:
	- Add the PW of tax savings due to the depreciation expense to the first cost.
- Savings or Expense:
	- Multiply by $(1-t)$ and convert to PW.
- Salvage or scrap value:
	- Multiply by $(1-t)$ and convert to PW.
	- Can be more complicated as will be seen when we look at the Canadian Tax System.

==Similar for annual comparison.==

## IRR Tax Calculations
The effect of taxation is to modify the pre-tax cash flows. After-tax IRR is the IRR calculated on the after-tax cash flows.
- Determining the IRR usually requires detailed analysis.
- An approximate IRR analysis when taxes are explicitly considered can be done very easily.

$$\text{IRR}_{\text{after-tax}} \approx \text{IRR}_{\text{before-tax}}\cdot(1-t)$$
## More Realistic Analysis
***Adjusted condition:* Asset has book value when it is sold**.
**Asset sale creates revenue, but tax implications are more complicated and must be assessed**.

## Depreciation and Asset Disposal

Taxes-owed changes based on different factors with respect to disposal:
- **Recaptured CCA (recaptured depreciation)**:
	- Occurs when an asset is sold for more than the book value.
	- Is reported as ordinary income (for which a higher tax rate applies usually).
- **Loss on disposal**:
	- Occurs when the market value is less than the book value.
	- Did not claim enough depreciation expense.
	- Occurs when an asset is sold for less than the book value.
	- Is reported as an ordinary loss.
- **Capital Gains**:
	- Occurs when the asset is sold for more than its original cost.
	- The excess over the original cost is a “capital gain”.
	- Occurs when an asset is sold for more than the cost basis (original value).
	- Is reported as a capital gain (for which a lower tax rate applies), **IF** the investment has been held long enough.


### Handling Asset Purchases and Salvage

#### Capital gain situation

Net Salvage of Land - Capital Gain
- Capital gain = Realized Value - Cost Basis
	- Taxes must be paid on a capital gain.
	- Usually at a different rate than regular income tax.

#### Loss or Gain on Disposal - possible methods

Books-open vs. books-closed assumption
- Applies to loss on disposal or recaptured CCA.
- Neither approach can be used if a capital gain occurs.


#### Books-closed Assumption

Net Salvage - Books-closed assumption
- Can apply when the asset has lost value.
- If over-depreciated, then funds are recaptured, and taxes apply.
- If under-depreciated, then a loss occurs, and tax credits apply.
- Net Salvage Value ($NSV = S\cdot(1-t) + B_d\cdot t$ )
	- $S$: Salvage value
	- $t$: Marginal tax rate
	- $B_d$: Book value at disposal
- Disposal tax effect (DTE) $= t \cdot  (B_d-S)$


## Capital Tax Factor and Capital Salvage Factor

- Capital tax factor (CTF) is a value that summarizes the effect of the benefit of future tax savings due to CCA.
- CTF allows analysts to take these benefits into account when calculating the PW equivalent of an asset.
- CTF is constant for a given CCA rate and interest rate.
	- Allows the determination of the PW independent of the actual first cost of the asset.
- When an asset is salvaged or scrapped there is an ongoing tax effect that can be summarized.
- When an asset is salvaged or scrapped the effect on the UCC is immediate and not subject to the half-year rule.
	- Equivalent measure is the capital salvage factor (CSF).

$$CSF = 1-\frac{td}{i+d}$$
$$CTF = 1-\frac{td(1+\frac{i}{2})}{(i+d)(1+i)}$$
$t$: taxation rate, $d$: CCA rate, $i$: after-tax interest rate.

- PW of the first cost (at the time of purchase) of an asset is found by:
	- Multiplying the first cost by the CTF.
- When an asset is salvage or scrapped, we need to terminate the remaining stream of tax savings.
	- Done by applying CSF.

## Components of Complete Tax Calculation

- Evaluating the economic impact of purchasing a depreciable asset goes beyond the impact of taxes on the first cost.
- Two other components in a complete economic analysis:
	- Assess the tax implications of the savings or additional expenses over the asset’s useful life.
	- When the asset is disposed, terminate the stream of tax savings resulting from depreciating the asset.

## Working Capital Requirements

- Firms usually have to pay for materials, equipment, rent, labour first, and later get revenues back. There is a lag, or gap, between when costs are incurred and revenues received.
- Firms need money (cash) to cover this lag. Money for this is referred to as **Working Capital**.
- Often working capital is only necessary at the start, but depending on fluctuations can be required at other times.

## Incorporating Loan Financing into Analyses

### Interest vs. Repayment

- **Interest** is paid on borrowed funds → this is considered an expense of doing business.
	- Interest is deducted from income before taxes are calculated: *it’s another operating cost.*
- Loan repayments, however, are not treated the same way.
	- They must be paid out of funds after taxes are paid.
- Interest payments can more easily be included into a ‘books-closed’ analysis.

## Effect of Inflation on After-Tax Calculations

- The value of depreciation deductions are diminished by inflation.
- Inflation reduces the real after-tax rate of return, even if the benefit increase at the same rate as the inflation.
- These considerations can also impact investment decisions.
