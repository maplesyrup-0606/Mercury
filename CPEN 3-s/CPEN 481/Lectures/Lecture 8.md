## Benefit -  Cost Ratios
- Commonly used in private sector.
- Can be based on PW or AW.

The ***conventional benefit-cost ratio (BCR)*** is given by:
$$BCR = \frac{PW(\text{user's benefits})}{PW(\text{sponsor's costs})}$$
A project is considered **desirable** if its BCR > 1.

The ***modified benefit-cost ratio (BCRM)*** is given by:
$$BCRM = \frac{PW(\text{user's benefits})-PW(\text{sponsor's operating costs})}{PW(\text{sponsor's capital costs})}$$

BCRM has the advantage of providing a measure of the net gain per dollar invested by the project sponsor.

**==The userâ€™s benefits are NET benefits.==**

Ex)
- PW of expected benefits: \$3M
- Construction cost: \$500,000
- PW of maintenance costs: \$50,000
- PW of construction disruption (negative benefit): \$75,000

$$BCR=\frac{3000000-75000}{500000+50000} = 5.3 > 1$$
Ex)
- PW benefits: \$37.5M
- PW operating costs: \$3.75M
- Capital cost: \$13.5M
- PW (reduced equipment requirements): \$2.25M

$$BCR=\frac{37500000}{1350000 + 3750000-2250000} = 2.50$$
$$BCRM = \frac{37500000-3750000}{13500000-2250000} = 3.00$$

Both the conventional and modified cost-benefit ratios are > 1. The project under either criterion is economically justified.

For **independent projects**, accept all projects with a benefit-cost ratio greater than 1.
To use benefit-cost ratios to choose among **mutually exclusive** projects, perform incremental analysis.

Suppose mutually exclusive projects, X and Y, with PW of benefits $B_X$ and $B_Y$ & PW of costs $C_X$ and $C_Y$. (We discard projects with a BCR < 1)

If both projects have BCRs > 1,  we rank the projects in ascending order by the present worth of costs.

If $C_X \geq C_Y$, then form the ratio of the differences in benefits and costs:
$$BCR(X-Y) = \frac{B_X-B_Y}{C_X-C_Y}$$
- If $BCR(X-Y) > 1$, X is preferred. Otherwise, Y is preferred.
- If $C_X=C_Y$ (in which case the ratio is undefined), we choose the project with the greater present worth of benefits.
- If $B_X=B_Y$, we choose the project with the lower present worth of costs.


### Ambiguity
It may not be clear whether certain positive effects are benefits to the public or reductions in cost to government. Or, whether certain negative effects are dis-benefits to the public or increases in costs to the government.



## Payback Period Analysis

**Payback Period** is the number of years it takes for an investment to be recouped (interest assumed 0).

Simple method for judging economic viability of projects.
If annual savings are constant, the payback period is calculated as follows:
$$\text{Payback Period} = \frac{\text{First Cost}}{\text{Annual Savings}}$$


- If annual savings are not constant, **payback period** is computed by deducting each yaer of savings from the first cost until the first cost is recovered.
- The project with the shorter payback period wins.
- Payback period of two years is often acceptable.
- More than four years is usually unacceptable.
