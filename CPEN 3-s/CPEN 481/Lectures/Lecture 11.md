**Inflation**: Increase in average price paid for goods and services over time.
- Results in a reduction in purchasing power.

**Deflation**: Decrease in average price paid for goods and services over time.
- Results in an increase in purchasing power.

### Meaning and Effect of Inflation
Suppose you get a raise next year: instead of \$50,000, you’ll make \$51,000. Your spending power rose 2\%.

But what if prices for all goods went up by 5\%, then spending power actually did not rose.

Inflation depends on:
1. Money supply: Too much money in the system → value tends to decrease.
2. Demand-pull: Increases in demand cause price increases, when supply can’t increase as quickly.
3. Cost-push: Producers of goods and services have to pay more for supplies, and pass the costs on to consumers.
4. Exchange rates

## Price Index

Price indexes measure inflation. They describe the relative price fluctuation of goods and services.
$$\%\text{ increase},n=\frac{\text{Index}(n) -\text{Index}(n-1)}{\text{Index}(n-1)}\cdot100\%$$

To calculate the average rate of increase, we use $F=P(1+i)^n$.

$$i=(\frac{\text{Index}(n+t)}{\text{Index}(n)})^{\frac{1}{t}}-1$$

There are two types of Cost Indexes:
1. Composite Indexes
	- To track historical prices of bundles or market baskets of assets
2. Commodity Specific Indexes
	- Ex: Construction labour, iron-ore, and other specific products

The most common composite index is the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**.
- It measures price changes in food, shelter, medical care, transportation, apparel, and other goods/services.

Ex) An item with a cost of \$1200 in 1997 is estimated to cost \$2100 in 2009. If the cost index in 1997 was 435, what is the cost index for 2009?
$$2100=2100\cdot(\frac{\text{index}}{435})$$
$$\text{index} = 761.25$$

### Power Sizing Model

Costs are affected by the size of equipment / infrastructure.
Costs don’t usually rise linearly though, due to economies of scale.
Power sizing model adjusts for this.
$$\text{Cost of facility 2} = \text{Cost of facility 1}\cdot (\frac{\text{Capacity of facility 2}}{\text{Capacity of facility 1}})^x$$
$x$ = power factor. In absence of more specific information, $x =0.6$.

### The effect of inflation on the MARR, IRR

If inflation is expected, MARR needs to be increased. If the inflation rate over the next year $f$, the real value of our cash flow is $M\frac{(1+i)}{(1+f)}$. And this can be used to define the **real interest rate**.

**The real interest rate**, $i’$, is the interest rate that would yield the same number of real dollars in the absence of inflation as the current rate yields in the presence of inflation.
$$i' =\frac{(1+i)}{(1+f)}-  1 =\frac{(i-f)}{(1+f)}$$
The **current MARR** is the minimum acceptable rate of return when cash flows are expressed in current dollars.
- When inflation is expected, then investors will require higher current rates of return than if inflation were not expected.
	- Current MARR then will be the real MARR plus an upward adjustment that reflects the effect of inflation.

The **real MARR** is the minimum acceptable rate of return when cash flows are expressed in real, or constant, dollars.

$$\text{MARR}_R = \frac{\text{MARR}_c -f}{1+f}$$
Which is basically the same as the **real interest rate** equation.

Similar operation is applied to IRR,
$$\text{IRR}_R = \frac{\text{1+IRR}_C}{1+f}  - 1=\frac{\text{IRR}_c - f}{1+f}$$
### Definitions

**Actual dollars**:
- What we normally think of as actually existing physically. The number you see on your bill.
- Sometimes called inflated dollars because they carry the effect of inflation.
- Market interest rates are connected to actual dollars.

**Real dollars**:
- Constant dollars that represent purchasing power of a base year (inflation-free dollars).
- Real dollars are calculated, by adjusting for inflation.
