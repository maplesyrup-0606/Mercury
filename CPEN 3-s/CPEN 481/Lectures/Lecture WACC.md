## MARR and Cost of Capital

How is the cost of capital determined?
- MARR is required to get investors to invest in a business is that business’s cost of capital.
- Cost of capital is also its MARR for projects.
- Project return on investment should be at least equal to the company’s cost of obtaining capital.


There are *two* ways of raising capital from investors:
1. **Debt**: from lenders
	- Pre-determined interest rates and repayment conditions.
	- Assets are pledged as security against defaulting.
2. **Equity**: from owners
	- Dividends are paid on shares sold.
	- Dividends are paid **after** all loan obligations are met.

Investing in equity is more risky than debt. But reliance on debt is limited for two reasons:
1. **Company**: Increasing share of capital from debt increases the chance of not being able to meet obligations to the lender.
2. **Lenders**: Aware of dangers of high reliance on debt and will, therefore, limit the amount they lend to the company.

### Company size and the Sources of Capital
- Large companies can secure capital both by borrowing and by selling ownership shares.
- The cost of capital for companies is weighted average of costs of borrowing selling shares, i.e., the **weighted average cost of capital (WACC)** which is also the MARR.
- The weights are the fractions of the total capital that come from different sources.
- For smaller companies, **the cost of capital is the opportunity cost for the investors**.

### Cost of Capital: WACC
Different sources of capital may have different “weights” in terms of the amount of capital AND have different corresponding “rate of return” (costs) associated with them.
- Yield to maturity rate is the relevant rate of return for bonds.

Weighted average cost of capital (WACC):
$$\text{WACC} = (\text{fraction of total capital})\cdot(\text{ROR}) + (\text{fraction of total capital})\cdot(\text{ROR}')$$
$$+(\text{fraction of total capital})\cdot(\text{ROR}'')$$

“After-tax” WACC for tax deductible items":
$$\text{After-tax interest cost} = (\text{Before-tax interest cost})\cdot(1-\text{Tax rate})$$
