## Computer Performance w/ Different Instructions

![[Pasted image 20240909192631.png]]
In Reality, we run more than one instruction set. Thus, we need to compute the whole execution time by the following:
$$\text{CPU time} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n IC_i\times CPI_i \right) \times \text{Clock cycle time}$$

So the above example would have,
$$\text{CPU time} = \frac{(0.4*1 + 0.3*4 + 0.2 * 2 + 0.1 * 3)\cdot 50 \cdot 10^9}{2\cdot10^9}$$

## Metrics
We have to known metrics for measuring performance:
1. **Latency**: How long to do X
	- Also referred to as response time or execution time.
2. **Throughput**: How often can it do X

**Benchmarks**
- Real applications / application suites.
	- e.g. SPEC CPU 2000 etc.

- Kernels
	- “Representative” parts of real applications.
	- easier / quicker to set up and run.
	- Often no really representative of the entire app.
	- Toy programs etc.
	- Not very useful for reporting.
	- Sometimes used to test / stress specific functions / features.


## Comparing Performance
Often comparing two different products (whatever it can be) really depends on what the usage is. The usage purpose and etc. all are factors on determining what is **relatively** better for you.

For instance, 
![[Pasted image 20240909194045.png]]
And also let’s consider the situation where we execute program B for only 10% of the time.

The relative performance of dell vs hp can be done by a weighted comparison,
$$0.9\cdot \frac{5}{6} + 0.1 \cdot \frac{3}{1} = 1.05$$So based on our usage, dell is 5% slower.


#### Different Cases

1. X is n times faster than Y
$$\frac{\text{Execution time}_Y}{\text{Execution time}_X} = n$$

2. Throughput of X is n times that of Y
$$\frac{\text{Tasks per unit time}_X}{\text{Tasks per unit time}_Y} = n$$

3. X is n times faster than Y on A
$$\frac{\text{Execution time of app A on machine Y}}{\text{Execution time of app A on machine X}} = n$$

But it isn’t that simple, X could be n times faster on A than Y, but Y can be y times faster on B and so on..

## Summarizing Performance

- **Arithmetic Mean**
	- Average execution time.
	- More weight is given to longer-running programs
- **Weighted Arithmetic Mean**
	- More important programs can be emphasized.
	- What do we choose as weights?
		- Most time the weights are unknown since there are a diverse variety of clients.


#### ***How to choose Means***
- Most studies use Geometric Mean while benchmarking.
	- Has the capability of damping outliers.
- Geometric Mean is **always** applied to normalized data.
- Geometric Mean prevents any one quantity to dominate speedup.
- Geometric Mean does not require weight information.
	- Can be constructed without prior knowledge of usage.
	- Therefore, it isn’t as accurate as weighted mean.


#### Normalizing & Geometric Mean
The speedup of arithmetic mean != arithmetic mean of speed up.

Geometric Mean:
$$\sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^n\hspace{.05in}\text{Normalized Execution time on i}}$$
What is normalized execution time?
→ The execution time of a system / configuration scaled relative to a reference system (baseline) typically set to 1

- Geometric mean is ***consistent whatever the reference machine is.***
- **Do not** use the arithmetic mean for normalized execution times.

#### CPI / IPC
Often when making comparisons in computer architecture studies:
1. When the instruction set is the same for both CPUs.
2. When the clock speed is the same for both CPUs.

We can directly compare CPI’s (and often we use IPC’s).

$$\text{Average CPI} = \frac{\sum{\text{CPI}_i}}{n}$$

**But the average IPC is not like the above!** We use the harmonic mean instead.

$$\text{Average IPC} = \frac{n}{\sum\text{CPI}_i} = \frac{n}{\sum\frac{1}{\text{IPC}_i}} = \text{Harmonic Mean of IPC}$$
